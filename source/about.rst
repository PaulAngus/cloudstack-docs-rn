What's New in |version|
=======================

Version |release| includes more than 70 bug fixes from the previous release.

Due to some changes in the community, we had an extented period of time 
without a release manager.  Because of this the 4.9.0 release is much larger
than usual and had a duration of about 6 months.

Going forward we should have more consistent releases again.

A LOT changed in this release, so this is not a complete list, but here is a 
quick summary.

* Nicira plugin integration has had quite a few improvements.
